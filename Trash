//ask where user is going

//what it must do: go forward one cell, turn right, check if branch right, 
//if branch right, update new known values (you know if theres something
//you can say theres one in front, and opposite on next cell). if nothing, turn left
//go streight one cell, etc. if turn right, nothing, turn left, nothing, turn left
//until something found (updating constanty)

//note on each cell movement, check if current cell == desired cell. if true, beep,
//go to optimization.
